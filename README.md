## Generating Gaussian Random Fields with Self-similarity

### Abstract:

We propose a method for simulating a class of second-order random fields with self-similarity. Our simulation strategy is inspired by the idea for simulating $H$-self-similar processes, provided by Peng and Wu (2025). The simulation algorithm is based on some modified Lamperti transformation, which bridges $H$-self-similar processes and stationary processes.  As successful applications, we implement this method to simulate fractional Brownian field, sub-fractional Brownian field, bi-fractional Brownian field, and tri-fractional Brownian field. Along with the above framework, we explore a method to define the bi-fractional Brownian field and tri-fractional Brownian field.
